SMW BACKGROUND IMAGE GUIDELINES

Static images should be PNG; animated images should be GIF.

All images should be 512Ã—432 pixels.

Images are numbered according to their order on the Spriters Resource background rip.

All GIFs should have delay set to 130 ms. Set frame disposal to "replace".

You can create the GIFs in GIMP. Each frame is a separate layer. The first frame is the bottom/background layer.
